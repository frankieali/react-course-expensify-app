            <p><strong>This course was just&nbsp;updated to support React v16 (React Fiber)!</strong></p>
            <p><strong>--</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Have you tried to learn React before?</strong></p>
            <p>It’s easy to go down the rabbit hole of libraries and tools only to come out of it not knowing how to
              build and launch a real-world React application. You get things configured, but you’re not sure how the
              libraries fit together (or if you’re even using the right one).</p>
            <p>Sound familiar? </p>
            <p><strong>I built this course to show you how you can build and launch real-world React web applications.</strong></p>
            <p>The Complete React Web Developer Course 2 starts with the fundamentals and covers everything you’ll need
              to build and launch React web apps.</p>
            <p>You’ll see what it takes to build and launch a React app, from the first line of code to the final
              production deployment.</p>
            <p>This course was designed around one goal: turning you into a professional React developer capable of
              developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.</p>
            <p><strong>You’ll learn React by doing, not watching.</strong></p>
            <p>From the first videos you’ll be building out each project as well as completing programming challenges
              I’ve designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.</p>
            <p>Throughout the course you’ll build two React web apps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The first app, a decision-making app called Indecision, is our starter application. You’ll learn the
                fundamentals of React while seeing exactly what it takes to get a React app up and running.</li>
              <li>The second app, an expense manager called Budget, has all the features you’d expect from a real
                application. You’ll set up authentication, user accounts, routing, testing, form validation, database
                storage, and more.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Stay up-to-date in an ever changing world.</strong></p>
            <p>The world of React changes fast, and that’s why I’m always working to keep this course as up-to-date as
              possible. You can jump in knowing you’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.</p>
            <p><strong>Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.</strong></p>
            <p>There’s no need to worry if you’re learning the right skills to land that React job or launch that React
              app. I’ve mapped out everything you need to know in an interactive easy-to-follow package designed to get
              you up and running in a couple of weeks.</p>
            <p><strong>There’s no better time to learn React.</strong></p>
            <p>React’s not going anywhere. Companies like Facebook, Walmart, Uber, Airbnb, and Netflix are all using
              React in production right now.</p>
            <p>They’ve also made heavy investments in the React ecosystem, creating new libraries and tools that speed
              up and simplify React development. From the biggest to the smallest, everyone’s using React and new jobs
              are popping up every day.</p>
            <p><strong>Get access to fast support if you get stuck.</strong></p>
            <p>There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to
              continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single
              question.</p>
            <p>I’ll work with you to get you unstuck and back on track. It’s one of the reasons students love taking my
              courses:</p>
            <p><em>“This is the absolute best course I've taken on udemy. Andrew is amazing at explaining things
                concisely, and the flow of the course is perfect. He doesn't skip over anything and he doesn't
                over-explain anything. On top of all that, he responds to questions so quickly that you won't be stuck
                at any point."</em> - Tanya Gamarian</p>
            <p><em>"The lessons are of high quality and even more important, he actually takes time to answer your
                questions!"</em> - Thomas Vercamer</p>
            <p>"The instructor does an excellent job in explaining how to build React Apps. He also responds quickly to
              any questions that are asked." - Matt Willy</p>
            <p>I guarantee that this is the most up-to-date and engaging React course available, and it comes with a
              Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>

        <p>I'm Andrew, a full-stack developer living in beautiful Philadelphia!</p>
        <p>I launched my first Udemy course in 2014 and had a blast teaching and helping others.&nbsp;<strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Since
            then, I've launched 3 courses with over 110,000 students and over 18,000&nbsp;5-star reviews</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong>I currently teach JavaScript, React, and Node.</p>
        <p>Before I ever heard about Udemy or thought about teaching, I created a web app development company. I've
          helped companies of all sizes launch production web applications to their customers. I've had the honor of
          working with awesome companies like Siemens, Mixergy, and Parkloco.</p>
        <p>I have a Computer Science degree from Temple University, and I've been programming for just over a
          decade.&nbsp;I love creating, programming, launching, learning,&nbsp;teaching, and biking.</p>
